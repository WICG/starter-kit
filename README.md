# WICG Starter kit

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/WICG/starter-kit.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)
Welcome!  This is a simple starter kit for writing [WICG](https://wicg.io) specifications, and adding new awesome features to the web platform.  In this repo you'll find templates and guides for using them.

## Process

Start with an explainer. [Learn more](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cJs7GkdQolqOHns9k6v1UjCUb_LqTFVjZM-kc3TbNGI/edit) and [get the template](https://github.com/WICG/starter-kit/blob/master/templates/explainer.md).  The explainer is critical to getting early engagement and understanding about what you'll be building.

When you move into writing the spec itself, use a document framework such as [ReSpec](https://github.com/w3c/respec) or [Bikeshed](https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed).  This will ensure that you apply the appropriate metadata and provide details to help people locate the spec and understand the structure.


## Install

Simply type the following and follow the prompts:

```Bash
npm install -g wicg
wicg init "My Awesome API"
```
